1- The error Permission denied typically occurs because the web server or PHP does not have write access to the storage or cache directories in your Laravel application.

	docker exec -it <container_name> bash
	chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
	chown -R www-data:www-data storage bootstrap/cache


2-./composer.json is not writable
	
	./vendor/bin/sail root-shell using root sail....
	chmod 666 composer.json
	chmod 666 composer.lock

3-The error indicates that Laravel's Filesystem class is unable to create a directory within the /var/www/html/vendor path, likely due to permission issues. Here's how you can fix this when using Laravel Sail.

	./vendor/bin/sail exec laravel.test bash -c "chmod -R 775 /var/www/html/vendor && chown -R sailuser:sailuser /var/www/html/vendor"
	./vendor/bin/sail exec laravel.test bash -c "rm -rf /var/www/html/vendor"
	./vendor/bin/sail composer install
